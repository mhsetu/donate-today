          Heavy monsoon rains over the past few days have led to rivers bursting
          their banks, cutting off around 2 million people in northeast
          Bangladesh. Many families are stranded and could run out of food
          within days.

            Bare Bayow Ali is a 67-year-old father of 6, and lives in Bula
            Kaskey village located at the Bank of River Juba in Eastern Bardera.
            He lives with his family in a semi-permanent shelter, and depends on
            his small-scale agriculture business. Unfortunately, the river
            flooding has swept away the ready-to-harvest crops in his farm
            leaving both his house and the farmland submerged. He says he had
            lost hope and wasnâ€™t expected to receive any help.

        <p>
          Floods have large social consequences for communities and individuals.
          As most people are well aware, the immediate impacts of flooding
          include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops,
          loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to
          waterborne diseases.

          It's an emergency made worse by both natural and manmade causes.
          Ponds, canals and haors, which once dotted these areas and
          traditionally served as reservoirs holding the excess water from
          floods, have all but vanished in recent decades, thanks to mindless
          development, urbanisation and flawed government policies.
